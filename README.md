**BratModel and RoBERTa Model Fine-Tuning Code**

**Introduction**

This repository contains code for fine-tuning the BratModel and RoBERTa models for question answering using the SQuAD dataset.

**Dataset**

The SQuAD dataset is a collection of 100,000+ question-answer pairs, where the questions are posed on Wikipedia articles and the answers are spans of text from the corresponding passages.

**Preprocessing**

The code in this repository preprocesses the SQuAD dataset by tokenizing the text and generating the input features required by the BratModel and RoBERTa models. The preprocessing also handles long documents by splitting them into multiple features with overlap.

**Fine-Tuning**

The code in this repository fine-tunes the BratModel and RoBERTa models on the SQuAD dataset using the ðŸ¤— Transformers library. The training process is configured using the `TrainingArguments` class, and the training data is batched using the default data collator.

**Results**

The following table shows the training loss and validation loss of the BratModel and RoBERTa models after fine-tuning on the SQuAD dataset:

| Model | Training Loss | Validation Loss |
|---|---|---|
| BratModel | 0.8546 | 0.9443 |
| RoBERTa | 0.6583 | 0.9788 |

**Usage**

To fine-tune the BratModel or RoBERTa model on the SQuAD dataset, run the following command:

```
python fine_tune.py <model_name>
```

Where `<model_name>` is the name of the model to fine-tune, either `bratmodel` or `roberta`.

The trained model will be saved to the `https://huggingface.co/96harsh56/xlm-roberta-basejapnes-finetuned-squad/tree/main` directory.

**Conclusion**

This repository provides a simple and effective way to fine-tune the BratModel and RoBERTa models for question answering. The code is easy to use and can be adapted to other question answering datasets.
