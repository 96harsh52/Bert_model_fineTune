# BratModel and RoBERTa Model Fine-Tuning for Question Answering

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for fine-tuning the BratModel and RoBERTa models for question answering using the SQuAD dataset. This project aims to provide a straightforward approach to train these models to answer questions based on text passages.

## Dataset

The SQuAD dataset is a valuable resource comprising over 100,000 question-answer pairs. These questions are derived from Wikipedia articles, with the answers consisting of spans of text from the corresponding passages.

## Preprocessing

In this repository, you'll find code for preprocessing the SQuAD dataset. This preprocessing involves tokenizing the text and generating input features necessary for training the BratModel and RoBERTa models. Additionally, the preprocessing handles long documents by breaking them into multiple features with overlap.

## Fine-Tuning

The core of this repository is dedicated to fine-tuning the BratModel and RoBERTa models using the SQuAD dataset, powered by the ðŸ¤— Transformers library. The training process is configured through the TrainingArguments class, and data batching is handled using the default data collator.

## Results

Below are the training loss and validation loss for both the BratModel and RoBERTa models after fine-tuning on the SQuAD dataset:

| Model       | Training Loss | Validation Loss |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| BratModel   | 0.8546        | 0.9443          |
| RoBERTa     | 0.6583        | 0.9788          |

## Usage

To fine-tune either the BratModel or RoBERTa model on the SQuAD dataset, execute the following command:

```bash
python fine_tune.py <model_name>
```

Where `<model_name>` should be either `bratmodel` or `roberta`. The trained model will be saved in the [96harsh56/xlm-roberta-basejapnes-finetuned-squad](https://huggingface.co/96harsh56/xlm-roberta-basejapnes-finetuned-squad/tree/main) directory.

## Conclusion

This repository offers a user-friendly and effective approach to fine-tune the BratModel and RoBERTa models for question answering. The provided code is straightforward to use and can be adapted for other question answering datasets as needed.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and adapt this project to your specific requirements. Happy fine-tuning!
